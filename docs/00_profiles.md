# Profiles - how to switch between local Orion and various Cloud workspaces

Prefect 2 makes it easy to **switch between environments**.

## Why Profiles?

  A single Prefect 2.0 installation can communicate with **multiple Orion APIs**, which can help you switch between development, staging, and production environments.

  As long as each profile points to a differentÂ `PREFECT_API_URL`, you can easily switch between multiple instances.

  Each profile can point to:

- a different Prefect Cloud workspace
- a different Prefect Orion API endpoint (e.g. for local development)

## How to create it?

  To create one, you can use:

    prefect profile create demo
    prefect profile use dev
    prefect cloud login # or prefect orion start

## How to switch?

  To switch between those, you can use:

    prefect profile use dev # or prod or any other profile

## Where is this file located?

```python
prefect config view --show-defaults | grep PROFILES_PATH
# PREFECT_PROFILES_PATH='~/.prefect/profiles.toml'
```

```python
cat ~/.prefect/profiles.toml
```

```toml
